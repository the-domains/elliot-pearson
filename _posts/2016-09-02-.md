**A curious path I came upon.**

From life to learning,

and learning from.

Though this path uncertain,

we, choosing, take.

So dreams can form,

In the lives we make.

We are not objects caught in time,

but life itself unfolding.

Our potential ever-changing,

a dream of mind's beholding.

We are, we make, we seek.

Through life's unknowns we go.

We think, we learn, we teach.

Explore, create and show.

So dare to be and go from here,

heed not the doubters slight.

Your future self will here be met,

whichever path you might.

Some say such dreams,

lack place and time.

But that now is here

in life's learning mind.
